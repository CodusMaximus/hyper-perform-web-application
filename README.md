# Hyper Perform

A simple rest wrap demo that returns hello world.

## Build instructions

```bash
mvn clean install
```

```bash
mvn wildfly:deploy
```

The above can be used to deploy the *war* to the wildfly server however the server must be run locally. Deploying to a remote server will be added at a later stage.
